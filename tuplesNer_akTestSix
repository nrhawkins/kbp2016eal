UKRAINE'S FORCES MOVE AGAINST PROTESTERS, DIMMING HOPES FOR TALKS

KIEV, Ukraine - Ominous new action by Ukraine’s security forces on Monday, including a raid on an opposition party’s headquarters, appeared to diminish prospects for talks between the government and protest leaders, as Western officials grasped for a way to defuse the country’s intensifying political crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of mounting alarm, Vice President Joe Biden and President José Manuel Barroso of the European Commission each called Ukraine’s besieged president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, to warn him against unleashing force on a mass demonstration movement in its third week. Senior envoys, including the European foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, and an assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, were dispatched in an effort to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
The renewed diplomatic maneuvering was intended to prevent a repeat of the bloodshed during a violent crackdown by the police on Nov. 30 and to contain the widening civil uprising, which has plunged this nation of 46 million into deep uncertainty. Caught in a tug of war between European and Russian interests, Ukraine faces a severe economic crisis and is in immediate need of an aid package that is unlikely to materialize while thousands of protesters and riot police officers are massed in the streets.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with senior Kremlin officials in Moscow on Monday, the State Department said, Nuland “urged Russia to use its influence to press for peace, human dignity and a political solution” and stressed Ukraine’s need for “a return to economic health with the support of the International Monetary Fund.”
</P>
<P>
The authorities seemed to lose control of Kiev on Sunday night after a huge rally of hundreds of thousands of people in Independence Square. On Monday, police forces and Interior Ministry troops were redeployed and began efforts to push protesters out of streets near main government buildings, including the presidential headquarters. Battalions of officers moved in and took up positions just outside the square’s perimeters, and by late Monday they had surrounded small encampments of protesters in the governmental quarter of the capital. After midnight, they began clearing those camps and cut off electricity to the occupied City Hall.
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening, Ukrainian security forces raided the headquarters of an opposition party, Fatherland, and seized computer servers.
</P>
<P>
The party’s parliamentary leader, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, is one of the main organizers of the protest movement, which ballooned in recent days to dominate the streets of Kiev and pressure Yanukovych after he refused to sign a political and trade pact with the European Union.

FORMER JPMORGAN EMPLOYEE SURRENDERS IN 'LONDON WHALE' CASE

Weeks after the U.S. government charged Javier Martin-Artajo, a former JPMorgan Chase employee, with hiding trading losses that ultimately reached more than $6 billion, he had his first day in court Tuesday as he surrendered to Spanish authorities and kicked off what could be a lengthy extradition process.
</P>
<P>
Martin-Artajo, a Spaniard who worked in the bank’s London office, was released soon after his surrender and arrest. He agreed to remain at the disposal of the Spanish judiciary, but it was unclear whether his passport was confiscated to prevent him from leaving the country, according to a person briefed on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges stem from a risky bet at JPMorgan’s chief investment office in London, where Martin-Artajo worked. The bet involved so-called credit derivatives, which allow traders to bet on the perceived health of companies like American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
When the bet soured in the spring of 2012, prosecutors claim, Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, a lower-ranking employee, deliberately overstated the value of their positions to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. The two were charged with wire fraud, falsifying bank records and contributing to false regulatory filings. Prosecutors also charged them with conspiracy to commit those crimes.
</P>
<P>
The arrest in Spain, the latest development in an episode that left a rare stain on JPMorgan’s once-stellar reputation, underscores the challenge U.S. authorities face in their pursuit of the traders. After announcing charges this month against Martin-Artajo and Grout, federal prosecutors and the FBI in Manhattan have encountered logistical hurdles.
</P>
<P>
British police issued an arrest warrant for Martin-Artajo at the behest of authorities in New York, and then visited his house in London only to find that he was gone. According to his lawyers, Martin-Artajo left London “on a long-planned vacation” to his native Spain without knowing of the pending charges.
</P>
<P>
Grout, for his part, left London this year for his native France, which typically does not extradite its citizens. His lawyer, Edward Little, explained that his client also spent a brief period in the U.S., where his wife’s family lives.
</P>
<P>
According to a person close to the case, both of the former traders have indicated through their lawyers that they are open to extradition but only if prosecutors recommend bail.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have not charged a third trader, nicknamed “the London Whale.” That trader, Bruno Iksil, has reached a deal with the authorities in Manhattan that will spare him charges as long as he cooperates against his two former colleagues.

VIGIL FOR MANDELA CONTINUES AS FAMILY MEMBERS HOLD EMERGENCY MEETING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG - Singing crowds gathered outside the hospital where Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s former president, lay in a critical state for a third consecutive day Tuesday, as family members held an emergency meeting at his ancestral village.
</P>
<P>
Mandela’s eldest daughter, Makaziwe, at least two grandchildren and clan elders gathered at Mandela’s retirement house in Qunu, the remote southern village where he grew up, according to news media reports.
</P>
<P>
The subject of the meeting was not publicly disclosed, but Naplisi Mandela, an elder of the Mandela family, told the South African Press Association that they had gathered to discuss “delicate matters” - a euphemism widely interpreted to mean preparations for Mandela’s death.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Pretoria, doctors continued to treat Mandela for a lung ailment that he contracted on Robben Island, the notorious apartheid-era prison where he spent much of his 27 years behind bars until his release in 1990. He was hospitalized June 8, his fourth hospitalization since late last year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, President Jacob Zuma said Mandela’s condition was unchanged. On Sunday, he visited Mandela and pronounced that his state had deteriorated from stable to critical.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Mandela’s 95th birthday is on July 18, Zuma urged South Africans to celebrate his achievements. Still, after 18 days of anxious vigil, many appeared to be steeling themselves for the worst.
</P>
<P>
Larger-than-usual crowds gathered at the gates of the Mediclinic Heart Hospital to pay tribute to Mandela, as people dropped off cards at a growing shrine and sang songs. “There is no one like you, Nelson Mandela,” one group sang in the Sotho language.
</P>
<P>
The emotional scenes were part of a perceptible shift in the national mood. Until recently, many South Africans had avoided talking about Mandela’s fate, calling it culturally inappropriate to speculate about any ailing figure, much less one as revered as Mandela, who played a central role in South Africa’s transition from white-led minority rule to historic multirace elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But now many are openly talking about the prospect of bidding him farewell.
</P>
<P>
Mandela’s declining condition came as President Barack Obama prepared to arrive in South Africa on Friday on the second leg of an African tour that will also take him to Tanzania and Senegal. But the South African government said a planned meeting between Obama and Mandela - both the first black leaders of their countries - now looked unlikely.

The St. Louis Rams fired coach Steve Spagnuolo and general manager Billy Devaney, the team announced on Monday.

The 52-year-old Spagnuolo was just 10-38 in three seasons in St. Louis after being hired in January 2009. Devaney, 56, was promoted to general manager in December 2008.

French far-left killer leaves jail
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ENSISHEIM, France, April 14, 2010 (AFP) -
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former militant of the French far-left group Action Directe, Georges Cipriani, left prison on parole on Wednesday after 23 years behind bars for two high-profile murders.
</P>
<P>
A policeman at the scene confirmed to AFP the identity of Cipriani, 59, who left the prison in Ensisheim in northeastern France wearing a leather jacket and with long white hair.
</P>
<P>
Cipriani was one of four members of Action Directe sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Renault chief George Besse in 1986 and the head of government arms sales Rene Audran a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The four included two women, Joelle Aubron who died of lung cancer in 2006 and Nathalie Menignon, who was paroled in 2008. A fourth member, Jean-Marc Rouillan, remains behind bars.

French far-left killer leaves jail
           
          
ENSISHEIM, France, April 14, 2010 (AFP) -
           
      
   
A former militant of the French far-left group Action Directe, Georges Cipriani, left prison on parole on Wednesday after 23 years behind bars for two high-profile murders.
    
   
A policeman at the scene confirmed to AFP the identity of Cipriani, 59, who left the prison in Ensisheim in northeastern France wearing a leather jacket and with long white hair.
    
   
Cipriani was one of four members of Action Directe sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Renault chief George Besse in 1986 and the head of government arms sales Rene Audran a year earlier.
    
   
The four included two women, Joelle Aubron who died of lung cancer in 2006 and Nathalie Menignon, who was paroled in 2008. A fourth member, Jean-Marc Rouillan, remains behind bars.
    
   
Cipriani left Ensisheim in a police vehicle bound for an open prison near Strasbourg where the police officer said he was due to do community service including working at a food bank as part of his parole.

IFC signs deal to expand insurance to farmers in East Africa
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- International Finance Corporation
(IFC) has signed agreements with three partners to expand access
to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in
Kenya and Rwanda to help protect their crops, animals and
livelihoods from weather-related risks and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
IFC, through the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF), will
confer grants totaling roughly 4.1 million U. S. dollars to the
Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture/UAP Insurance
weather index insurance initiative in Kenya; the International
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Livestock index insurance
project in northern Kenya; and the MicroEnsure weather index
insurance project in Rwanda.   "These partnerships highlight
IFC's commitment to expanding insurance and other financial
products where they are needed most in Africa. The Global Index
Insurance Facility will facilitate farmers' access to credit,
leading to increased productivity, improved livelihoods and
greater food security," Jean Philippe Prosper, IFC Director for
Eastern and Southern Africa said.   "We are grateful to the
donors that have generously provided funding and to our partners
for supporting this program."
</P>
<P>
The grants, the first three provided under the GIIF program, will
help bring weather-related, index-based insurance to about 35,
000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in East Africa over the
next three years.   "The implementation of these three first GIIF
projects in Kenya and Rwanda will support the development of new
insurance products and will increase expertise in this field,
which will benefit smallholders and livestock keepers affected by
climatic events," he said.  "In addition to the GIIF, the
European Union is providing further financing to the ILRI
Livestock Insurance project in Kenya through the 10th European
Development Fund, Kenya Rural Development Project that will start
in 2011."
</P>
<P>
IFC will confer a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on Syngenta
Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, which expects to help
insure 20,000 farmers in Kenya over the next three years
</P>
<P>
IFC will confer a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the ILRI,
which expects to help insure 5,000 livestock herders in northern
Kenya over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
IFC will confer a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on
MicroEnsure, which expects to insure 15,000 farmers in Rwanda
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
IFC's GIIF program was established in 2009 to assist the
development of index-based insurance for natural disasters and
weather risks in developing countries, where insurance is rarely
available.
</P>
<P>
The grants will fund advisory activities, including local
capacity building, infrastructure development, product
development, and development of local insurance companies'
capacity to provide index-based insurance products.
</P>
<P>
Index-based insurance insures against catastrophic events, such
as wind storms or droughts, depending on their severity.
</P>
<P>
Index-linked insurance products eliminate the need for insurance
companies to individually verify claims, reducing transaction
costs and making it easier for the products and services to be
offered to rural communities and in frontier regions.
</P>
<P>
The European Union committed 24.5 million euros as the first
donor to the GIIF Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
The fund is also supported by Japan's Ministry of Finance with an
initial grant of 2 million dollars, and the Dutch Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, which provided funding to establish the
facility.
